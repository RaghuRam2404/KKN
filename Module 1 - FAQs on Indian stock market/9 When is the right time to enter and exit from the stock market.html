<h1 id="toc_0">WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO ENTER AND EXIT FROM THE STOCK MARKET?</h1>

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js" ></script>

<script src="../toc.js" ></script>

<div id='toc'></div>

<p>Every time you look at the market from outside, it always looks volatile. You should be wondering if you should invest when the nifty levels rise? Or should you listen to tv advisors who tell you to wait till the correction happens and the market gets back to normal?</p>

<p>One of the bitter truth is, when it comes to investment and the stock market, people even after being smart and intelligent, have their own emotions towards it. That’s the reason there is a lot of research happening around behavioral finance.</p>

<p>If you check the screener website and go through any company, say TCS, you can see a lot of ups and downs in the graph in 3 months. It&#39;s difficult to decide at which point you should have entered the market seeing this volatility. Right?</p>

<p>So some may say, you should learn technical analysis so that you can get an idea of when exactly to enter. That might hold for traders for a short period. But let&#39;s look here from an investor&#39;s perspective.</p>

<p>We all know about TCS, one of the best IT company in India and IT field sector have been doing well in the last 20 years. Now I want you all to check the one year graph of TCS, still looks confusing right, too many ups and downs. Again it&#39;s difficult to decide when to enter or exit.</p>

<p>Let’s go through the graph of the last 10 to 15 years of TCS. Can you notice something? Seems good right? Now can you decide when to enter and exit the market? I see that at any point in time in this graph if I enter I could have made a lot of money.</p>

<p>Timing the market is not a good idea from an investment perspective. So you rather have to understand more about the stock market and other types of investment. If you are sorted on the investment side then you will be sorted on the equity side as well.</p>

<p>All of us have great respect for Warren Buffet. He says “<strong>Cash is a bad investment</strong>”. Cash is the money that is lying in your account, maybe in savings or the current account. The current account does not give you any returns. Even savings account has some 4% returns in India which is still very low.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s discuss why cash is a bad investment in the Indian scenario. If you have kept your savings in the form of cash in your Almira, think what would have happened? In recent years demonetization happened, if you have saved in cash form, it would have been a nightmare and a really bad idea.</p>

<p>Even if it didn&#39;t happen and think you had converted all your hard-earned money in the form of new notes, let&#39;s think about other scenarios. Imagine you had one lakh rupees in the form of cash then ten years back that money would have been worth something. But today, that money would be worth twenty to thirty thousand only.</p>

<p>My point here is money is losing its value every day. Something which you would have brought for 100Rs 15 years back, you would not be able to buy a similar product with similar value today. So cash is not going to give you any good return.</p>

<p>So where can you place this cash then? Other investment options are real estate, gold, FD, and stocks. Mutual funds and other exotic products which you hear from investment advisors are the combinations of these products only.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">REAL ESTATE</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s understand each of this one by one. Till the time you think, real estate that you are investing in is a need, it won&#39;t disappoint you. But the moment you start building more houses than required by the population or end-users, who are capable to buy the houses, then it becomes a very bad practice which has already happened in India.</p>

<p>You would have seen the scenario of real estate for the last 10 years, from 2011 to 2019 people have suffered huge losses in real estate. Especially people who invested in houses. Before that there was a bull run for the housing market, it was coming as one of the biggest asset class in India. People were doubling their money a year or two. But then they started buying more n more houses and losses started to incur. There is this real estate crash that keeps happening, like the last 7 to 8 years. Maybe now it is at a stable price, but it is all about timing the market.</p>

<p>Real estate is something that is your need and instead of giving any return, it needs money for the maintenance. So placing real estate into investment class is something I will not agree with, especially when you are buying land.</p>

<p>But we can agree that over the years the house prices will increase and that is the return you are going to make in real estate. But have you ever thought of other disadvantages of it? Now think you bought a house for one crore rupees and if you want to go to another house it’s again huge money. And buying these for a loan of 7% to 8% is again a nightmare for you because this is the return you are going to get anyway from other asset classes. Right?</p>

<p>But if you are buying farmland, it can give you grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. So if you are investing in real estate as farmland, we see that it is a producing asset. So the investment which you are building should give you an actual return.</p>

<p>Farmland is going to produce something and that’s why its prices will also increase. So, agricultural produce is also something which is also a return, an increase in the price of the farmland is also a return and it will not get old, unlike houses.</p>

<p>Real estate is an investment only when it can produce something for you. I would like to give you a suggestion that, if you already have a home, next time buy farmland and not house again.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">GOLD</h2>

<p>If you collect all the gold in the world and make it in the form of a cube, then you will be able to make each side of 67 feet cube. Well, do you want to buy that? Or if I say that out of a similar amount of money equal to gold, that is around 7 trillion you will be able to probably own top 30% of the US companies. What will you opt for? I would surely opt for the companies rather than gold.</p>

<p>Do you think the gold is going to produce you anything? It is one of the most useless metals I would say. We Indians are so much fancy for gold as an investment and asset. We are highly exposed to gold because of our cultural needs like marriages. This is not going to be something that will produce anything. You should depend completely on the movement of gold prices. You have to keep watching its price and there are chances of gaining and losing money. The total compounded annual return rate on the gold will be something near to what you get on a fixed deposit or maybe 2% higher than that.</p>

<p>But the philosophy behind my class on telling you about all these investments is, some assets can produce you something and multiply at a compounded rate. There is also an asset that hypothetically does not do anything for you. Gold and real estate as houses can appreciate to a certain level in a very long run. But as such it will not produce anything and only ask for maintenance from you.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">FD</h2>

<p>Why is the bank paying you an interest? Because they are giving this money to a potential businessman who invests in different businesses and they in return pays the bank a higher interest rate than FD. That is Bank Business. If the bank takes your money and invests in many businesses and makes this whole phenomenon there own business, then why can’t we start investing in that business on our own.</p>

<p>Now we are left with STOCKS/SHARES/EQUITY</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">STOCKS/SHARES/EQUITY</h2>

<p>Stock is a good investment according to me. But you need not invest all your savings in it just because I am telling you. Investing in stocks is about investing in the business. So a business giving good profit will grow multiple times by each passing year and we have already discussed this power of compounding in the previous class.</p>

<p>Stock investment is probably the best investment of all the asset classes which is going to produce products and services of your needs and that’s why it will grow faster and give you faster results as well.</p>

<p>Did you know that in the US there are so many organized sectors and many companies performing well, hence there are a lot of choices for investors to pick up. But in India, there are hardly a few companies which you can trust 100%. We keep hearing bad news about different businessmen doing malpractice, siphoning money, running out of the country, etc.</p>

<p>So today’s generation and everyone active in the market have a big responsibility and you need to invest in yourself, your ideas. If you are capable of doing that, investing all your savings into your own business is like buying 100% of its shares.</p>

<p>So investing in yourself, your ideas, your health, and your education, so that you become more skillful is much more important than investing anywhere else. That’s not philosophical and that’s the truth. You should believe in yourself.</p>

<p>And also you should invest in a productive asset. Altogether we have four productive assets now i.e real estate, gold, FD, and stocks. So all of us have certain apprehensions regarding our future, and we need to keep some money in FD as well.</p>

<p>But even that small FD may not help you much. Rather you should plan your finance in terms of insurance also. By being worrying about bad times and keeping your liquid money aside is not a good idea.</p>

<p>From my experience, I know many people who keep two to three lakh rupees into their account for emergency purposes. Trust me this won&#39;t be of much use in your bad times. Your term insurance, personal accident insurance, health insurance is going to help you in bad times. If you are not insured well and you lose those 2 to 3 lakhs of hard-earned money, then think what if bad times come again?</p>

<p>So staying insured is probably the right thing. And keeping money in unproductive assets like cash is a bad thing. You can invest in farmland and stocks, which can give you good returns. Some companies over the years have given even returns of 1000%.</p>

<p>I am not promoting anything here. You should invest in productive assets and you should have your definition of identifying those. When I talk about stocks, you should not blindly go and invest in them or time the movement of the stocks or look for the price of the company. All you should learn is value the company. If you start looking at the price of the stocks, you will get confused with when to buy. Again you will be stuck in the behavioral finance loop and not able to decide.</p>

<p>Here in India, you may not have many good companies but we have enough of it which can multiply your money. Think if you are going to select 10 companies and only 5 is going to be right, trust me, you are going to be wealthy. You will get multiple times to return. You just have to learn to value the company. You do not have to time the market or time the share prices. We will learn in more detail in fundamental analysis classes.</p>

<p>So when is the right time to enter and exit the market? My idea about investment is to invest only when you have money. If you have one lakh rupees in your account and know well about the stock market and value of a company, then you can invest 30% to 50% of your savings into equity. If you invest at any level with a good company with a long term goal, you will get good returns in stocks as well.</p>

<p>As a country, if we have to become a superpower, we need to have a lot of businesses. So the answer for this class is to invest when you have money. Also, you need to take care of portfolio management as well as risk management, which we will discuss later.</p>

<p>And when is the right time to exit the market, it is when you need money. As simple as that. You can exit the market in the following situations like</p>

<ul>
<li>When you need money</li>
<li>If the companies fundamentals are not as strong as before or if there are issues.</li>
<li>If you have a better alternative</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not exit based on bull and bear market or share prices. They keep coming and going, what lasts is the performance, profitability, and business model of the company.</p>
