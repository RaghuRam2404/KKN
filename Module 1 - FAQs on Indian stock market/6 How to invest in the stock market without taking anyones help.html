<blockquote>
<p>An important key to investing is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets. <br>
– Peter Lynch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many are fearful when it comes to investing in the stock market. We keep hearing stories of many people being cheated by tip sellers. Majority of you have been searching for this one answer on how can I invest on my own without doing deep down research.</p>

<p>Well! Here we go…….</p>

<p>There are passive ways of investing in the stock market and this is what we will be learning today. The underlying factors of those products through which you can passively invest in the stock market is fully based on learning these basic concepts of</p>

<div><pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-none">What is nifty? What is index?
What is ETF?
What are mutual funds?
Different types of mutual funds.</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s understand in detail about nifty and the index. Why is it important?</p>

<p><strong>NSE is the largest stock exchange in India and nifty is its base index. Sensex is the base index of BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange]</strong>. Now let’s go to the NSE website and check on live market, then go the equity stock market. It shows you a default list of stocks. The number of stocks there is 50 and its called nifty 50.</p>

<p>There are many other indices like broad market indices, sectoral indices, thematic indices etc. But we shall be learning more on nifty 50.</p>

<p><strong>An index is an indicator or measure of something and in finance it typically refers to a statistical measure of the change in the overall securities market.</strong></p>

<p>The authorities selected top 50 companies of top 15 sectors of the economy to include in nifty 50. When I say top 50 companies that may not hold true always, there are more criteria also.</p>

<p>The companies they select will be based on good companies, widely held companies, good market capitalization, lot of customers, with good track records. You can see the list includes like ADANIPORTS, ASIANPAINTS, AXISBANK, and BPCL...Etc. The list goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Consider you are investing into all these companies together, so in a way it means you are investing into overall economy or overall stock market as well.</strong></p>

<p>Is each of them given the same weightage in the nifty 50??</p>

<p>Well, no! They get calculated as per their investible weightage factor. There are some companies which have 2% to 3% weightage, some even own 7%. So it differs based on the companies.</p>

<p><strong>The overall performance of the nifty gets calculated as per the change in every stock, multiplied with the weightage it has been given. Then they cumulatively calculate the overall change in the nifty 50. The change happens on the daily basis. This index value keeps changing as per market conditions.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of identifying and investing on individual stock, what if I told you can buy nifty itself as a share??</p>

<p>Yes it is possible! You can invest directly into nifty and it’s done through two methods.</p>

<ol>
<li>Through ETF</li>
<li>Through index mutual fund</li>
</ol>

<p>You can buy nifty at current price and when the value increases your invested money also increases. Same happens when the market falls too.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">ETF</h2>

<p>It stands for <strong>Exchange Traded Funds</strong>. It trades like a stock throughout the day, unlike mutual funds which trades on specific time period only.</p>

<p>You can buy the ETF through your trading demat account just like you buy the stocks. The concept of ETF is, companies pool money from lot of people put together and invest this money for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>The purpose can be a diversification to balance the risks. <strong>Instead of buying just one stock you buy ten stocks, this is called as diversification</strong>. If you are buying all 10 stocks from the same sector, then it’s concentrated to one sector and risk is more. So what you need to do is diversify among many sectors and within those sectors one or two companies will be pooled together.</p>

<p>Some ETF’s can be very concentrated and some will be more diversified. Idea here is they have to go and achieve one objective.</p>

<p><strong>So now we know that you can invest in the performance of the nifty and when the nifty goes up you will make money and if nifty goes down you will lose money in the same proportion.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So how to directly go and invest into nifty?</strong></p>

<p>For that you need to go and find out the weightage of each stock in nifty and buy only that much of value of stocks only into your portfolio. But doing in this fashion is very complicated and you won’t be able to achieve as a retail investor. Your minimum investment size may go up to 10 to 15 lakh to achieve it.</p>

<p>So in order to simplify it, some companies came forward and said that give us the money and we will allocate this money in such a way that, it will track the performance of the nifty itself.</p>

<p>To track such instruments <strong>ETF was made which can be traded on stock exchange just like the stocks</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>You can check out the various ETF’s on NSE India website. Highly traded ETF currently is the nifty 50 ETF. So with just a small amount, you can actually invest in the nifty ETF’s without anyone’s help and still get benefited from the market. You can check the individual prices of the ETF by clicking on the details of each of them.</strong></p>

<p>Since the whole market has to grow, this investment may not give you huge returns, but overall <strong>10% to 11% compounded annual rate is there on most of the indices</strong> around the globe. In India also FD rate is 7% to 7.5%, and then you can expect a return of 10% to 10.5% on nifty ETF for another four to five years.</p>

<p>If you are investing for a short term, chances that the market may crash and you may lose money in the ETF. So it’s not a risk free instrument. ETF can also give a hit on your portfolio. Keep buying every quarter with a perspective of investing for the long term.</p>

<p>There are many other companies too which are managing the ETF’s as you saw in the website. But my suggestion would be to choose something which has highest liquidity. NIPPON INDIA ETF NIFTYBEES is having the highest liquidity. Every time you come to market both buyers and sellers are available with this nifty bees. There is also NIFTY BANK BEES which track the nifty banks.</p>

<p>Since it gets traded like stocks, you need to give a brokerage on this. You are aware of the brokerage you give for the stocks; similar kind of brokerage will be applicable for your nifty ETF performance as well. But you need to check with your broker and it should not be high.</p>

<p>Apart from the brokerage since the companies are involved in managing it, so there will be certain management fee as well. But it is very very low when compared to the mutual funds investment.</p>

<p>ETF’s are very popular in western countries, now in India also it’s getting popular because of the low management fees. <strong>So ETF is one way of investing in the stock market without taking anyone’s help and still track the performance of the stock market.</strong></p>

<h2 id="toc_2">INDEX MUTUAL FUND</h2>

<p><strong>Mutual fund is a financial product from asset Management Company</strong>. In simple terms mutual fund is a collective fund of common people which gets invested into equity or other market.</p>

<p>Now we shall know more on below topics,</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a mutual fund</li>
<li>Mutual fund Vs direct equity investment</li>
<li>Types of mutual fund</li>
<li>Pros and cons of mutual fund investing</li>
<li>Alternative of index mutual fund</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are companies which gets license, that are very expensive and get approval from authorities to pool fund from different people and invest into the market.</p>

<p>In return for managing your fund, they charge you some fee. They charge you around 1.5% to 3% in equity mutual funds. So they promise you to manage your investment and give better returns. So their objective here is to generate better returns for you than the market or better returns than what you can generate for yourself. One professional or a group of professional hired by asset management companies take decisions and invest the money.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">WHAT IS PASSIVE INVESTING?</h2>

<p>Many think mutual fund is a passive investment! But it’s not.</p>

<p>Before saying much on it, let’s understand the basics of passive investing.</p>

<p><strong>The philosophy of maximizing the returns by minimizing your cost of buying and selling by not actively participating in the market is called as passive investing.</strong></p>

<p>Passive investor believes in value investing and he invests his money into one asset class for a very long period or say until the time he sees the fundamentals of the product going wrong.</p>

<p>So there are so many products. Like you can think of a person who wants to buy a land. He plans to keep it for another 10 to 15 years and enjoy it after his retirement. So he is a passive investor, who knows the land prices in this country will keep increasing and have seen it in his last 10 to 15 years of life. He does not actively check if the price of the land is increasing or if he has to time that and invest again once he gets doubles the amount after selling the first land.</p>

<p>There are also people who buy the land and keep it until the price increases and sell it off. Then they invest again in some other land wait for price appreciation. I know some people like this who make money by timing the land. In land also you need to give transaction cost which is higher like 7% to 8%.</p>

<p>In equity market, every time you buy or sell shares there is certain brokerage fee and expense ratios like transaction cost, impact cost etc. and there will always be a timing issue.</p>

<p>As I said earlier <strong>passive investor believes in long term investing</strong>. However mutual funds managers are not passively investing into equities. They are constantly checking for good opportunities and that’s why they charge you 2.5% to 3% of total amount.</p>

<p>The mutual fund companies claim that,</p>

<ul>
<li>They will keep looking for good opportunities</li>
<li>The health of the company where they have invested</li>
<li>They will always look at the competition</li>
<li>Always see that whether they are invested into the best of the stocks or they have alternate list of stocks they can shift to.</li>
</ul>

<p>So holding equity mutual funds for long is not a passive investment because internally it is managed actively. Let’s quickly make a comparison of mutual fund and direct equity.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>MUTUAL FUND</th>
<th>DIRECT EQUITY</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fee can be as high as 3% of total fund</td>
<td>Fee can be as low as zero with discounted brokers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Someone else decide on your money</td>
<td>You decide on your money</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Limited return have been observed</td>
<td>Exponential returns have been observed</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>I believe in direct equity rather than the mutual fund. As a teacher I have responsibility to tell you my belief. That’s the reason of launching the course on equity.</strong></p>

<p>What I really don’t like in equity mutual funds is their fee. A country where the GDP is not growing at 7% to 8% and mutual funds charging a fee as 3% is really a high charge. Whether the fund gives returns to the investor or not, this charge will be deducted every year from the investors. Like when you invest your 100 Rs, in that 2.5 to 3Rs will be kept aside and invested in the equity market. That’s how they have to generate a 10% to 15% return to give you a decent one.</p>

<p>When you invest on your own with good knowledge on equity, it’s your money and you take the decision. You have the judgment of a good company which won’t be same as mutual fund manager.</p>

<p>I have observed from past many years that <strong>in mutual fund there is a limited return</strong>. It’s my opinion. Very few mutual fund companies in India have given a return of 15% and above to their investors.</p>

<p>Now we have heard about many companies growing from stock price of 10Rs to 30 Rs up to 10000Rs to even above. <strong>In direct equity exponential growth has been observed and we have seen the living examples</strong>. You can take the example of growth of reliance. Its current value is many times double than the price it started with. So <strong>high returns is possible in equity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">CAN YOU INVEST IN NIFTY/SENSEX INSTEAD OF INVESTING INTO SHARES BY YOURSELF?</h2>

<p>Well yes! We learnt it earlier that through nifty ETF you can directly invest into market. Well we know that it’s not possible to match and track every components of nifty on our own, then investment size could be high and to solve this issue companies launched ETF and mutual fund. Let’s explore more on mutual funds now as we are aware of ETF.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">TYPES OF MUTUAL FUND</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>EQUITY</th>
<th>DEBT</th>
<th>HYBRID</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>It invests mainly into equities, shares, stocks</td>
<td>Mainly invests into debt products</td>
<td>A combination of both debt and equity products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>They are categorized as large cap funds, midcap funds, small cap, multicap, thematic, sector specific.</td>
<td>Like government securities,debentures,Commercial papers</td>
<td>Child plans, pension plans, monthly income plans.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>But there is one special type of fund which provides you this feature of passive investment. This fund believes in the fact that market is always going to be here and it will grow.</p>

<p>Our topic of concern is <strong>Index fund</strong>. It’s a type of equity mutual fund only. But the fund manager instead of taking decision directly to invest in certain company, they rely on another data i.e. it can be nifty index, bank nifty index, sensex index.</p>

<p>So you have to identify how many types of indices are there and within that index how many companies have launched the index funds.</p>

<p>The only job which the company that manages the index mutual fund does is they keep on tracking the components of these indices with the weightage what has been assigned for that equity and accordingly they manage.</p>

<p><strong>So index fund is other one through which you can passively invest into nifty or other index and you will get the return of what nifty return is going to be in a specific time horizon.</strong></p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Is it safe or not??</h3>

<p><strong>Yes in few cases it is safer as you can see you do not have to do in depth research and believe in one theory. The theory here is stock market is never going to end. The capitalism will always be there, so companies will have to generate profit. Nifty being the prime index in the largest stock exchange in India will sustain for long.</strong></p>

<p>When you look back, nifty started with 1000, it’s now around 9000 and has increased up to 12000 too. So we now realize that even through index fund we can generate good returns on our overall capital.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">WHY INDEX MUTUAL FUND?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You get the passive return of what the market is giving.</li>
<li>Unlike the other direct equity mutual funds, here the fund management fee is as low as 0.1%. However it ranges from 0.1% to 0.5% in some of the fund houses.</li>
<li>Since the job is to just match and track nifty, companies do not charge like 2% to 3%.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this is one method to invest in different index mutual funds and get passive return from the Indian stock market through the benchmark indexes of your choice. Just believe in on index and invest. The company risks will get mitigated automatically.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">ETF Vs INDEX FUND</h2>

<p>Well the return on investment in both of these products is proportional to return on nifty. So the returns from both will be almost equal, as its tracking the nifty. Except slight difference in their charges. Though there is slight difference in fund management fee among both, but still it’s very low compared to 5 to 6 years back. Still let’s see what the actual differences are;</p>

<table>

<th>INDEX FUND</th>
<th>ETF</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Expense ratio ranges from 0.1% to 0.5%</td>
<td>Expense ratio is as low as 0.05%.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It’s more like a mutual fund</td>
<td>It’s more like a stock</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No need to open trading demat account</td>
<td>It will be executed on exchange and you need to have a demat and trading account</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Every time you want to buy the index fund, like mutual fund the allocation to your account will happen on the end of the day. Closure NAV. [Net asset value represents a fund&#39;s per unit market value]</td>
<td>Can be bought or sold during market hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No brokerage though there is slight higher expense ratio</td>
<td>There will be brokerage charge; you need to check with your broker or go with the discounted brokers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You don’t have to worry about the impact cost as you are not directly involved with the buying or selling. The fund managers will manage it.</td>
<td>There can be a liquidity issue and can cause an impact cost</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimum you can start with 500/- Rs as investment. Even in fraction of units as per the prices of NAV, your allocation will happen.</td>
<td>It can be invested only in the multiple price of one ETF.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Liquidity</strong> refers to how easy it is to buy and sell shares of a security without affecting the asset&#39;s price.]</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p><em>Now we know the major differences in these two and when it comes to returns, there is no much difference in both. These two are passive way of investing in the stock market.</em></p>

<p><em>I cannot tell you which is better. I don’t mind having a portfolio of both of them.</em></p>

<p><strong>So some people might not be good at doing in depth analysis of different companies.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some of you want to just invest and not interested in knowing details.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The whole agenda of including these topics in the introductory classes was to benefit such people and provide the right information and make you invest passively without any help.</strong></p>
