Welcome to the last class of module 1. Let me quickly brief you about Module 1. It was about Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) by common people like you and me who are either new to the market or have spent some time but still, they have some basic questions which need to be answered. Through these questions, I have tried to explain some basic concepts and warned you about the malpractices.

We also became familiar with terms and markets. By the end of this module, now you are aware of,

* Why does the stock market exist?
* How do people make money or some lose money
* Different kind of risks in the market
* The power of compounding plays a major rule
* Why the market is volatile
* Ways to invest on your own through ETF
* Things to take care while opening your Trading and Demat account
* Difference between investing and trading
* Why one cannot time the market
* The right time to enter and exit the market
* Different kind of stocks and approaches
* Types of brokers in India
* How to select a broker in India

The very last topic which will be covered in detail is about who else is there in the market who are investing and how are they doing? You must be curious about it.Some serious investors are investing and making a difference. Let’s open the website of NSE India, Moneycontrol.in & Screener.

Let’s go for the Nifty index which has a list of 50 Stocks in them. We will try to find out who are the investors in these stocks. We can also observe who are the people and up to what extent they have invested in these companies. We will look for the Share Holding pattern to find out the answer for who are other investors and the type of investors in the stock.

There are four main types of Share Holders in any company,

* Promoters
* FII/FPI
* DII
* Others

We will learn in detail about them. Let’s take an example of Reliance Industries Limited and other companies as well and draw some conclusions. Let’s stick to one holding pattern of Reliance Industries Limited. In website like Moneycontrol.in four quarters are displayed, and you can also find the data from Day 1 of the company as this is a Public Data which is available.

Looking at the last four-quarter data of Reliance Industries we can see that 50.05% of the stocks are being held in the name of promoters i.e people like Mukesh Ambani who started the company. Reliance Industries was started by his father and he inherited this business and made this better day by day. It is India’s one of the largest companies.

I am personally proud of this company because they have done so many great things and that’s why they have given good returns. This is one company that brought polyester to India, made communication cheaper, opened huge refineries, made cheaper clothes available for Indians and various other businesses. They are the one company that has given huge returns to its investors. This is a 10 Lakh crore company which has given 10 times returns in the last 13 years. However, if you go with historical data then you will see that this return is much higher.

## Promoters

These are the people who are there as shareholders also. If we see in the last four quarters of Reliance, we can learn that promoters were having 47.19% shares in December 2018 & 50.05% share in September 2019. The conclusion which we can draw on such a shareholding pattern is that this is a very good trend.

A promoter who has started the company, diluted the company shares and from 100% he comes down to 30%, 40% or 50% and he has given away his shares to retail investors to raise the money. Now if these promoters are increasing their stake in the company, it means that they are doing well, their company is doing well, and they have belief in the company and that’s why they are buying back shares.

In my personal experience, this is a healthy scenario, but it doesn’t mean you should go and buy just by seeing the shareholding pattern. Let’s check other examples i.e. Yes Bank. Let’s see the shareholding pattern of Yes Bank was in December 2018 promoters holding was 19.82% and in September 2019 promoters holding was 13.05% which is vice-versa of Reliance Industries.

To understand such a difference, I will explain to you one practice that happens in the stock market which is called Buy Back. Let’s take an example, think you are holding a share of ABC Company. Share is trading at 500RS and you are holding 500 shares. That company is making a huge profit and they have no place to invest further. What will they do? They can give a good dividend to the investors. Right?

But they may not give all the money as a dividend. They still have surplus cash. What can they Do? One of the practices is that companies buy back the share at a higher price and this option is only for the existing shareholders. But they can also include a clause where all the shares can’t be surrendered at a higher price instead only 10% of your shareholding can be surrendered at a higher price. This is another way of rewarding the shareholders of the company.

In such a scenario when promoters are not surrendering their shares, but you have surrendered your shares, then companies buy back your shares and holding of the promoters increases in the company. Buy Back will be explained in full detail in later classes.

Now we know about different types of shareholders and this is a good trend where promoters holding is increasing in the company. It means people who are running the company have confidence in the company.

In the second row, it is written pledged, this is a case where promoters put their shares in the hand of lenders to raise money. When companies are in trouble then promoters pledge the shares on debt with the anticipation of making the company better. Promoters can also pledge the share for the personal purpose or to start another company. Pledging of shares is a bad sign.

The company that has given 3 times return has 0 pledged shares and the company that has crashed almost by 90% has pledged their shares significantly. This is another learning we have. This may not be always correct. But it’s good to look into it.

## FII – Foreign Institutional Investors

Any institutional investors sitting outside our country is called FII. They come to our country because they think that they can earn a better return from India. After all, it is a growing, larger, and stable economy. To understand the nature and behavior of FII, we must understand one example.

In India, we have a fixed rate of return of 7% that is offered by most banks on FD. In the USA it ranges from 0.5% to 1.5% because money is available in the USA and money is scarce in India. Why USA is giving low returns on FD? They are already a grown economy. They have a surplus of capital. They are a developed nation. But in our country companies are expected to grow at a higher rate and this becomes beneficial for FII because in developed economies the scope of development is less as compared to a growing economy.

That’s why they diversify themselves & move to a growing economy. They invest in India for this reason. Some scenarios go against FIIs also. To make you understand the scenarios that go against FIIs, let’s understand another example. Let’s assume the price of 1 Dollar is 70RS now and the price of 1 Dollar was 20RS in 1991 so when our economy got open, Dollar is appreciating against Rupee means Rupee is getting weaker.

With the current scenario, 1 Dollar can even go for 80RS in upcoming years. If One FII comes with 1 Million Dollar which is around 7 crores and he invested this 7 Cr in the Indian Market and two years have passed and this 7 Cr is turned to 8 Cr with 13% return in two years. For you, this 13% return can be less but for FII this might be a good return. But the moment they must go back home they cannot go with the rupee. The FII who came with US dollars must go back with US Dollars only. And after these two years, 1 dollar is 80RS. When FII is going to convert this 8Cr into Million Dollar, then it will turn out to be 1 Million Dollars only.

Now we observed that even after 13% return they made 0% return on their capital invested in India. They have the advantage that money is cheaper for them, but they have their disadvantage that due to the depreciating nature of currency in India against dollar they might not make huge returns.

With this example, we want to highlight that all the shareholders have their problems because it’s business at the end of the day and businesses have risks associated with them. There are people equally exposed to risk in the Stock market and FIIs are highly exposed to currency fluctuation.

## DII – Domestic Institutional Investors

THE biggest DII is LIC in India which is Life Insurance Corporation. LIC invests your money in the Stock Market. LIC is selling you policies where they offer you both risk coverage & return. To give you that return LIC places your money in different kinds of companies and different sectors. They are called institutional investors.

If we simplify, we will get to know that Mutual Funds, Insurance, and Other categories belong to us i.e. retail investors only. In most of the companies, you will observe that retail investors are lying in the others section. Instead of giving our money as a management fee to Mutual Funds, Insurance Corporations & Financial Institutions, if we learn basics of investing, portfolio management and risk management, we can directly go and invest in companies and create a portfolio of companies like Reliance, Infosys, TCS, and few other companies from other sectors.

This class was all about who were the different types of investors in the stock market. I have told you all to do a small exercise on the shareholding pattern of Nifty 50 companies and I found one interesting thing in this exercise that is ICICI, ITC & L&T have no shareholdings from the promoters.

Is it possible that promoters don’t have shareholdings? YES, promoters may dilute their shares so much that they become normal to shareholders and come in others category itself. ICICI started as Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India. This was a PSU but Dodge and Cox International Stock Fund (FII) and LIC hold a good amount of stocks in ICICI.

Don’t get worried in situations where you see promoters are not having any holding and this is still ok where Management is running the company. If you see a shareholding pattern in Infosys which is a great company started by Mr.Narayan Murthy and his colleagues have altogether now 13% as promoters because they diluted their shares early. They requested that they should be put into other categories and not in the promoter’s category. Most of them retired early and they jumped back to normal investors which are completely possible.

If you go and crunch the data, then you get to know different information, and this is the data that we got, and there can be companies with no promoter’s holdings and still be good for investing.


## Conclusion

**If the promoter’s shares are increasing, then it is a healthy sign.**

**If promoters are pledging their shares, then it is a bad sign.**

You know the Pain area of FII and the reason why FII come here.

If you look in DII, then you will understand that in DII the majority of money is from retail investors only.

LIC & Mutual Funds pool money from retail investors only.

This was the last class for Module 1 Which included knowledge about market, malpractices, assumptions & myths which aimed to make you comfortable with terms of the stock market and making the course interesting.
