I keep getting queries from people about this class and some who are new to the market is very confused with this topic. So I have compiled all of them into a single topic.

People sometimes want to invest lump sum money and let's say around 5 lakhs to 50 lakhs. They want to know should they invest at one go or part of it, or weekly or monthly. I will be explaining further on which fashion you are supposed to invest money and different approaches towards the accumulation of stocks into your portfolio.

And many are confused about should they invest in bluechip companies/ multibagger stocks/ large-cap/ small-cap companies and are they put together like that for a reason. We will learn about the different types of stocks. You may be wondering if they have defined bluechip companies for a purpose. You can choose the ones that define you.

Then we shall learn about different avenues to invest in the stock market like mutual funds, PMS, etc. Whether you invest in them or not, knowing about them will make you more aware of the market.

##SIP VS LumpSum

Let's look at the implication of investing in both ways like monthly or quarterly or if we invest in lumpsum. We will understand better with an example. Think one person earns one lakh a month and can save 50000/month and out of which he decided to invest 20000/month.

Investing in the stock market is about creating a portfolio. But for you to make it easier to learn, let's say there is just one stock and we are going to invest 20000. Think that stock price is 200Rs and we should calculate its implications in one year along with the nifty movement. You can follow the example of excel in the video.

So from the above scenario I tried to replicate you, the difference is moreover the same, when it comes to SIP or lump sum investment. Not always will the SIP approach works better than the lump sum.

But the idea is when you go and invest at different levels and if you see that the stock prices are down as the market is moving down, you need not have to worry. You have to keep investing, thinking that the market is having the problem and not the company. The change in prices is due to the whole market fluctuation. Have faith in the company and keep on accumulating stocks and you can stick with your SIP approach ( Systematic Investment Plan).

Generally, the SIP is pitched in mutual funds, but you can create your SIP also and it will have better risk management automatically. You will have better control over your emotions in market fluctuation. Many times market risk is also covered in this.

When you have a lump sum approach and your waiting period is good, you will have good returns and meanwhile can get dividends also after a year. But one issue here is, if the markets come down, you may incur losses. And at that time if you want to liquidate your stocks, then you have no choice but to book a loss. Then you may ask how can we cover this market risk? We will be discussing this in detail in our futures and options chapter. They are made mainly of risk management.

I would say if you are not well aware of how to hedge the bigger portfolio against the market risk, it is better to start with the SIP approach and still come out as a winner in the market.

If you are very clear that you won't need the money that you are planning to invest shortly, then you can take up the lump sum approach. But if you foresee a certain scenario where you may need the invested money, then it's better to go with the SIP approach. Even if you have a whole amount, keep investing a fixed amount every month, till the time you have invested all the money at a different level in the market.

You know that every stock is correlated with nifty. One should always remember that market risk is always there. If markets come down every stock will also be down. If the market is down by 10%, we should invest in such companies which come down to 1% to 3% and when the market is moving up by 5%, our stock should move above 5%, this is the ultimate target of everyone, to beat the market.

If you do not want to beat the market, you simply go and invest in the ETF, which is a passive investment. Investing in ETF will give you the return of the market which is much better than FD return when holding for longterm.

**SUMMARY**

There are two approaches to invest,

* **SIP- This will help you manage the market risk.**
* **Lump-sum- There is market risk, but if your portfolio is above 9 to 10 lakhs you can even manage the market risk which we will learn in futures and options.**

**Some people get panicked when the market is down, and book a loss due to behavioral finance. If you are a novice person, you should go with the SIP approach and test the market for 3 to 6 months. It is completely fine even if you have not taken the stock as an asset in your portfolio till now. Make sure that you go slow, so that you do lesser mistakes and stays in the market for very long.**

##Classification of Stocks Classes

Today we will concentrate on the classification of stocks and you can develop a model based on that.

###STOCK CLASSES

This classification is based on the ownership level of the stocks.

* Common stocks
* Preferred (P1 category on NSE)
* DVRs

Common stocks are the ones I show you generally on the NSE website. They give you the benefit of the voting rights. And the moment you buy the stocks of any of those, you also become a shareholder. The normal retail investor may not get voting right because of the fraction of shares they possess. But regular shareholders get the voting rights, dividend, and in the long run, you will be benefited from the growth of the company.

There are other categories of stocks that these companies issue, they are called Preferred stocks. There are no voting rights for this. Using these stocks companies generally raise money through private placements. These stocks are listed on NSE under the P1 category, you can check once. Preferred stock valuation and transaction is something that has to be done differently, we will focus mainly on the other two types. Also, we have very limited choices of preferred stocks. So I will not be explaining more on this valuation in the coming classes. Because in these stocks you are promised a fixed dividend every year, and there are no fractional ownership rights like that of common stocks. They are priced differently, though you enjoy a higher dividend than that of common stock.

Some people get confused about DVRs with preferred stocks. In DVRs, you get different voting rights. Generally, these get higher dividends but lesser voting rights i.e differential voting rights. Every time a company thinks that they want to raise the money through shares but do not want to dilute the rights, they bring DVRs.

Most of you know about TATA Motors. If you check them on NSE, you can see that they have DVR share and also it has a normal share. Sometimes DVR is at a discounted rate and this keeps happening. DVR has lesser voting rights. It was constructed in a way that promoters can define that if you buy 10 DVR shares, you get voting rights that are equal to one normal share. This was the case sometime back.

But around a year back, there is a new rule like companies can issue DVR shares with more voting rights also. This is a change that happened due to new-age startup funding where some people want to give money, they don’t want a lot of shares but at least they want to have their say into the company. So even after having lesser shares they can have higher say and negotiate it with the founders of the company.

Otherwise, in general, DVRs are issued when companies don’t want to dilute enough voting rights and still want to raise money. People go for it because they give a little better dividend than the normal shares. Some people may simply go and start finding DVR shares after knowing this and they may think, anyway they will not exercise their voting rights ever, so I can buy DVRs and enjoy better dividends. There are not many DVRs in our country.

### CLASSIFICATION BASED ON MARKET CAPITALISATION

* Large-cap
* Mid-cap
* Small-cap

Companies that are largely based on market capitalization are called large-cap. Most of these companies in nifty 50 include in this category. They are stable, they have liquidity in the market. They have good cash and diversified business. Companies with a market capitalization of anything above 5000 to 10000 crores can be put in this category.

Any company below 200 crores market capitalization belongs to a small-cap company. Anything between 200 to 10000 crores will fall under mid-cap companies. Overlaps keep happening between the 3 categories and there is no fixed definition.

Large-cap company's nature of business is different from that of small-cap companies. Capital protection chances are higher in large-cap. But let's say you got a company of five lakh crores. Is it possible for it to become a 50lakhs crores company in 5 years? The answer is no. It’s a very rare chance to multiply 10 times. The reason is they are already large and they have catered to the need of a large portion of the market. Now they will not start overselling the company.

For example, think TCS has become a 7 lakh crore company because it has served the market size of the IT industry by 30 to 35%. Other market players are serving as well. TCS cannot go and over serve the market. It may become 100% but can never go and serve 300%. They have to serve as per demand and they are already the market leader. Large-cap companies' capital appreciation will be less. They will give you a return of 15% to 20% and not like getting doubled every year.

However, if you go to a small company, can a 100 crore company become a 1000 crore company? Yes can be, they still have to go and capture the market size. For that, they have to grow. But, they also have a high chance of getting into trouble, unlike large companies that have a good backup and a lot of learning which has already happened.

In a small company, there is a bigger risk. Any small change in the industry can impact them. This is a very personal choice based on the risk appetite of a person, which to choose. When it comes to practical note its more to do with the risk-taking ability of a person.

According to me, a person at the age of 50 should stay in large-cap companies. If around 25 to 30 years, you can research a little and take the risk and invest in small-cap and mid-cap.

### CLASSIFICATION BASED ON DIVIDEND PAYMENT

* Growth stock
* Dividend stock

As per the example, I had explained you can see that, stock market work on the philosophy of the power of compounding. When the companies earn money, they reinvest and that’s how they become larger companies over a while. Such are called growth stocks

But if there is a situation where the company has already become big and do not know what to do with the retained profit, then they go and distribute it among their investors. These are called dividend stocks.

It’s a matter of choice for the companies management to decide how much money they want to reinvest and how much money they want to give as a dividend. And sometimes it’s a necessity like, if the business is growing fast you may choose to reinvest the whole money and investors will also be happy as the business is growing there stock prices will also become more.

These choices are based on the sector the companies are providing the service, and what stage of business they are in, you should know these before you invest.

But some invest with the expectation of getting a good dividend every year. In fact on quora, as per my learner's request, I have published a list on dividend stocks.

### CLASSIFICATION BASED ON VALUATION

* Overvalued stocks
* Undervalued stocks

This is completely based on the intrinsic valuation of the company. Mr.Damodaran, whom I think like the god of investing, who has written a great book on valuation also says that “ Though I am teaching you an intrinsic valuation, it's almost impossible to find the right intrinsic value”. Share prices are different, which are based on the future income of the company. But the real value of the company could be something else, that is the intrinsic value. Then there is also book value which I have explained in earlier classes.

This is a very debatable classification. Some people may find a company undervalued but others may find it overvalued. If this classification would have been so simple, everyone would buy only undervalued stocks. But these things are in theory, you can create your theory for classification based on valuation.

### CLASSIFICATION BASED ON RISK

* Bluechip stocks
* High beta stocks

Think like if the market is up by 1% then stocks are also up by 1.2% and vice versa. Then we would say that the beta of the stocks is 1. Beta defines the volatility of the stocks.

A less volatile company is a bluechip company and a company more volatile is a high beta company. Companies like L&T, Reliance which is spread across many sectors is less volatile and they do not move up or down like crazy, such are bluechip stocks.

But some stocks move up by 3% one day and decreases by 2% another day, such are beta stocks. Especially traders choose high beta stocks and investors choose bluechip stocks.

### CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PRICE TREND/ ECONOMY

* Cyclicals
* Defensive


When it comes to the food and beverage industry, it does not matter where the economy is going, people will buy the food and it is a necessity. Every company that comes into this category which serves the very basic needs of the people is called defensive stocks. Pharma companies, ITC, HUL comes under this. Irrespective of the economy cycle/ price changes they will stay in the market.

There are other sectors which depend on the economy and not catering to the very basic needs of the people. Such are called Cyclical stocks. For example, sometimes the country itself may not be doing well and to invest in infrastructure you don’t have money and for infrastructure development you need steel, hence steel consumption gets reduced. Similar is with the auto sector, if the economy is down, you may not have money to buy your planned car, so you will postpone.

All of us keep hearing about the news of the economy, so you should know well whether you are into cyclical or defensive and track accordingly. Cyclical stocks may perform well when the economy is performing. And defensive will perform well even if the economy is not good.


##Mutual Funds

So initially you learned about one of the ways of investing by lump sum or in a SIP approach. Then we learned another way where you can decide the kind of stock you want to choose. And now let’s see how exactly we can invest without taking someone’s help or what are the different methods through which you can invest in the stock market.

We have already covered Nifty ETF in the previous class. It is something which is tracking the market and you can invest in Nifty ETF directly and that is one way of passively investing in the stock market.

To do active investment you are doing the learning part where you will do relative valuation, learn to create a portfolio, and learn different methods of risk management and make yourself capable enough to manage your equity portfolio which will be an active equity portfolio.

Your target here would be to beat the market. So if market or Nifty ETF is giving 12% return in a year, if you are doing it actively or you are taking certain calls on the stocks for a very very long run, your one of the agenda will be wealth creation. It will be in a way beating market also and in another way identifying certain stocks which can give you multiple time returns in the long run.

So two ways are there when you directly want to do it yourself. One is the active way for which you are learning and the passive way in which you can start tomorrow by simply buying Nifty. This is also a way actually, alright.

Another way all of you know is a mutual fund, there is an issue with a mutual fund that they charge a very high fee approximately 2% + mutual fund managers + taxes and all they charge you in the equity portfolio.

The case is similar to PMS. It is another set of advisory where a portfolio management company takes 50 lakhs of a minimum fund to manage. It used to be 25 lakh but now its 50 lakh and again they charge you 2.5% upfront. Different PMS’s have different charges. But these charges are again very high which is anything like 2.5%. So they ask you so much money from your portfolio and that can reduce a lot of return in the very long run.

So you have to see whether you first trust some people who can manage your fund effectively. And if you have enough funds to go with PMS 50 lakh rupees. So it does not apply to everyone. People who only have 50 lakh rupees will go to a person having a PMS license and get there fund managed from them. They charge you both, a fixed fee and a performance fee. So if they are making a 20% return they can put a clause that they will take some money out of the total profit as well, apart from the fixed expense.

In mutual funds they generally have a fixed expense which they deduct every month, every year and they manage your money through the equity market as well. Another form is an investment advisor. So SEBI-Security and Exchange Board of India, they also facilitate investment advisory license to people who know about the field and can advise people.

Now, these investment advisors may charge you anything between 500 rupees to 50,000 rupees, depending on what exactly is their objective. Honestly speaking, now that you all know me, I was into this industry. I don’t belong from any of this category and that is why every time someone asks about stock advice, I refrain giving it. It’s because I have worked in institutions and then I am working for myself, so I am legally not allowed to give a stock recommendation, knowing a subject and teaching a subject is different from giving a recommendation. Making a return for myself is different and tracking it and just giving one advice is more like a tip seller, which I don’t want to become. But yes, there are registered investment advisors if you have a good trust in them you can go to them as well.

My team is also pushing me now to go and take an investment advisory license for ourselves self and we may plan it. If we ever do it we will 100% communicate with you. I am not upselling myself here within the course but even if I am doing that I will not do it to students who are still learning in the first three months. I am still enjoying this teaching job and my ultimate goal is to go and train a lot of people so that the ecosystem of the stock market becomes better for which I don’t need any license.

I studied in BITS Pilani, worked in different companies, and then practiced for the last 5-6 years myself. So I have a belief that I am not misguiding anyone or teaching a wrong thing. I am always ready to learn from my students also. So I am more like a teacher right now. That’s why I have requested multiple times to many people that, don’t ask me directly for the equity. I am making you capable to identify yourself, I will validate that once you come with certain examples.

But if you directly ask me that will not be an ethical way. So you also have to go and check with people who say that I have an investment advisory, I have got the good qualification and I can tell you this story behind every company that why they will grow.

You can also become one of the investment advisors after this course. This is again another purpose of mine, that’s why I have included the career section as well. So, these are the different ways through which you can invest. Either you can manage by yourself or by going to someone you can get your fund managed in the equity market.
