This is a very generic and exciting topic. Let's learn the mechanism of working of stockbrokers, how do they make money, how each of you is connected with a stockbroker and the malpractices that have been involved earlier. I will try to give the inputs from the perspective of the stockbroker.

Some people ask me if we can invest in the stock market without a stock broker. The answer is once a company had become public and brought its IPO and its shares are listed in the stock exchange, you have to go through the broking route to purchase shares. The stock broker is an integral part of the whole equity market.

Stockbrokers advertise that they will help you invest in the stock market by opening trading and a Demat account. In the previous chapter, I have told you that your Demat account gets opened with a depository and they help you with a trading account. They charge you a brokerage for that which is their revenue.

So stockbroker is a person between exchange and the investor. His job is to make money from you into his trading account and help your orders to send to exchange, buy the shares on behalf of you and send it to your depository account which is with NSDL OR CDSL.

And when you want to sell, they take instruction from you, either a pre-instruction in the form of POA or Delivery Instruction Slip and ask the shares from the depository and sell it on exchange and give the money back to you.

Every time they buy and sell on behalf of you they will charge a brokerage. There are basically two types of trades,

* Delivery trade
* Intraday trade

Some recent brokers do not charge you any brokerage like Zerodha, Upstox etc on delivery trades. This is a new trend in India brought by Zerodha where you can buy the shares and sell after some time with zero brokerage, they are called Discounted brokers.

We can categorize brokers into Full-stack brokers and Discounted brokers. Full stack brokers along with giving you the platform, provide you call and trade kind of service. So you will call and place the trade and they will take the instruction on the phone, and they are always available. ICICI direct, Motilal Oswal, Aditya Birla, Angel broking, etc comes under these Full stack brokers.

I am not favoring anyone here. You have to use your own wisdom in choosing the brokers. Discounted brokers generally earn through intraday trades. So they give a platform where you can do a lot of leverage trading into derivatives, cash segment, and other segments.

So there are two types of brokers and both do a similar kind of job. There was a time when our traditional kind of brokers used to charge 1% of brokerage. So if you have to buy shares worth 10 lakhs, probably 10000 will be their brokerage along with additional charges. But these days even the Full stack brokers negotiate the charges if you reduce it. They can give you anywhere like 10 to 20 paisa brokerage.

Let me tell you few things about the broking industry before learning how to choose the brokers. Let's say a brokers job is to help you buy and sell the shares and they make money only when you buy or sell the shares. This is something to ponder upon.

Let's say you opened an account of 10 lakh rupees with one of the stockbrokers and you negotiated with him that you will give 20 paisa brokerage. So he will get a brokerage somewhere between 2000 Rs and you brought it to invest for longer period, maybe you will sell it after 10 years or only when you need money. Then the stockbroker will make money only after 10 years from you. Right?

Now there is another broker who tells you that they have a very good advisory team who will keep advising you for active investments like, buy today sell tomorrow (BTST Trades). Or you can do leverage trading where you can make good money by trading intraday. Why are they giving you this advice?

Most of the time this advice comes with no cost and sometimes a stockbroker becomes a stock advisor as well. And here comes the biggest conflict of interest which I shall explain in the next class.


So we are aware of what exactly are stockbrokers and what is their role. And when it comes to choosing a stockbroker, you must select based on your need. Depending on your wisdom, your understanding of the stock market, and the importance of the stockbroker, you need to select one for you.

Let's understand the costing involved with the broker. Let’s say a person has 10 lakh to invest. We know there are full-stack traditional brokers like ICICI Direct and discounted brokers like Zerodha.

Now if you go to a discount broker he will charge you zero as broking fee while buying and selling for 3 years. There will be no other charges other than government GST and security transaction costs, which is unavoidable.

If you go to a full-stack broker, they will charge you 0.5% of your investment as a brokerage. They will charge you GST as well. So for 10 Lakh Rs, there will be 5000Rs brokerage.

Some because of the trust factor, they will go to traditional brokers and they are not bothered by 0.5% brokerage. And the moment they invest the brokerage of 0.5% will be deducted. There is the second line of full-stack brokers who will reduce the brokerage fee if you negotiate, as there is good competition now. This is based on my personal experience. Some give you a 0.1% to 0.2% fee as well after negotiating.

There is a reason why they are giving a discount on the brokerage fee. What I am saying is not something you will find in a book. It is from my personal experience and this is the setup in India. Most stockbrokers have become advisors and giving free advisory. To make this industry better, what I feel is, a stockbroker should not be an advisor and vice versa.

What happens is, there comes a conflict of interest. Now if you are going to be just a long term investor for 3 to 30 years, then what the stockbroker understand is,

* They took lots of effort to get you on the platform. So there is client acquisition cost.
* To engage a client they need to maintain records, data, keep support employees, etc. So there is client engagement cost.
* So they will not be happy to earn just 2000 Rs as a fee from you.
* So they start telling you ways to make money another way like trading than just investing.
* They start calling you and promote you to time the market and do the trades. So that they start getting broker fees.
* Now this will create a conflict of interest. So here stockbroker is giving you free advice so that they keep you excited to do a lot of buys and sell every day. And they make money through you.
* Most of the time clients lose money.

I am not saying all are like that and not defaming anyone here. But this is the trend we can see nowadays. I feel SEBI should bring a strict law about this differentiating stockbroker from advisors. If this does not stop and keeps happening then discounted brokers will leap in the future as they generally don’t give you free advisory. This is based on my observation.

So when you are choosing a stockbroker, you should make sure they are not giving you unsolicited unnecessary free stock advice all the time. They are not very forcing and asking you to trade again and again.

If you are going to be a long term investor, then choose full-stack brokers. You can negotiate with them well and give them a small brokerage. If you are going to be a trader then you can negotiate and chose a discount broker based on your needs.

Many try their luck in trading with discounted brokers without backtesting their strategies. It's up to you to decide. Luck may not favor you all the time.

Another thing to check is the client service of the brokers. Different companies have different service agreements with clients. Many times they do not follow it and people would have given feedback about it on their website. So check on the internet if they are delivering the services committed by them.

You can also check on SEBI, about how many complaints have come against any broker. Brokers may get involved with wrong practices. So you need to check if they have a lot of complaints or not.

Some think big brokers will not fail. But that’s not the case. You should use your judgment and select the right stockbroker.

The reason for including this class in the first module is to tell you the importance of this topic. A broker who is chasing you, again and again, may not be the right broker. A broker's responsibility should be giving the right broking services. Social media has made a lot of things more transparent. Before opening an account, check out all the positive and negative feedbacks about them.

Next is about the POA( Power of Attorney). A good broker will listen to you when you say you don’t want POA as you are investing for the long term. And If the broker is ethical and ready to support you they will open the account without a POA. So that your money will be safe for the long term and any kind of malpractices will not happen.

Do thorough research before opening the account with the stockbroker.
